bgstyle

A simple set of scripts for handling background colors in different applications.

Background "style" (dark, light) is picked up from the file ~/.bgstyle.

The style is not forced in any way, but applications can pick it up, e.g. by watching
for changes of the config file.

Example use case is to add this to the vim config file. This will only set the applicable style
when the config file is read (usually at startup).

```
function! WrSetBackgroundStyle()
  let l = system('bgstyle')
  let l = substitute(l, '\n$', '', '')
  let background_env=l
  exe 'set background='.l
endfunction

call WrSetBackgroundStyle()
```
